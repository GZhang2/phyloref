Phyloreferencing using OWL Ontologies and Reasoning
===================================================

This repository contains a phyloreferencing ontology and examples of phylogenies encoded in OWL using OWL-DL reasoning to match phyloreferences to nodes in the phylogeny.

This is entirely experimental at this point. (Re)use at your own risk. If you do, please give credit, for the time being by citing this repository.
